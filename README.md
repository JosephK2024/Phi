# Phi
An exploration of different languages and styles to someday create an application.
Named this way cause it sounded cool ðŸ‘Š


## Code Type
> [!NOTE]
> Following shows pros with (+) and cons with (-)
 - Java
   - Doesn't work multi-platform well (-)
     - No Linux interpereter built in 
     - Crostini doesn't like the Java engine
   - Not limited to single window (+)
 - JavaScript/HTML
   - Limited mainly to browser implementation (-)
     >Frameworks can fix this however are too many for easy selection
     >ALSO creating HTML code by using JavaScript is tedium incarnate
   - Has easy access to multi-platform  (+)
 - Python 
   - Has built in Interpereters in Windows and most Linux distros (according to Google; personal Crostini device didn't have it) (+)
   - Not limited to single window (+)
   - Google(and their AI) says it can be easily translated and kept as machine code
   removing the anxiety with giving this out to others eventually (will I ever?) (?)
 > [!CAUTION]
 > **Using multiple seems like a recipe for disaster with how I work**
