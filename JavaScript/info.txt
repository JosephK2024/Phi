Attempting to learn how to use JavaScript to do multi-platform
    First need to learn file extension
        .js
    Second learn how to run js files
        Requires html?

Might be a good idea to switch from Java and JavaScript for an easier time for me
    no it wont, would require a Java interpereter
        linux would hate it along with mobile
