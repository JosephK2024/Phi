## Java
First program confident in

Might be best to just use one window for the application instead of stretching between more
 > Could use boxes to create connections inside single window with clickable "links" that expand when touched/hovered to show more info
 > See app "Obsidian"

Completely gave up on using Java for cross platform reasons (linux environment is not pretty with Java)
 > This file is saved currently for reference when creating in other langs


## JavaScript
Attempting to learn how to use JavaScript to do multi>platform

First need to learn file extension
 > .js
Second learn how to run js files
 > Requires html?
 >>Framework could change this

Might be a good idea to switch from Java and JavaScript for an easier time for me
>No it wont, would require a Java interpereter
>>Linux would hate it along with mobile
